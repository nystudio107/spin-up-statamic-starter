# Spin Up Statamic starter

This is a starter kit for adding [Spin Up Statamic](https://github.com/nystudio107/spin-up-statamic) to your existing projects.

Spin Up Statamic allows you to create your own self-contained Statamic project complete site config, Antlers/Blade/Twig template files, assets, and devops shrink-wrapped with Docker, which you can distribute to others or use yourself.

Use it for:
- Spinning up a Statamic site in a browser in GitHub Codespaces
- Shipping a self-contained Statamic site to others
- Providing working example code & projects to others
- Spinning up a local Statamic project using someone else's `composer.json` for support

**N.B.:** This is _not_ intended to be a fully functional local development environment for client sites (there is no `buildchain`, for example).

## Adding Spin Up Statamic to an existing project

You can install the Spin Up Statamic scaffolding into an existing project by running the following command while inside that projects's root directory:

```shell
php please starter-kit:install nystudio107/spin-up-statamic-starter
```

Please see the [Spin Up Statamic](https://github.com/nystudio107/spin-up-statamic) repository for more information on using Spin Up Statamic.
